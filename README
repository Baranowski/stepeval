TODO:

The measures to avoid name conflicts are not perfect. For example:
(\x x' -> x x') (x' x)
renames both lambda patterns to x''. Whoops.

Pattern matching can see deep into bindings, which may make how it found
a match non-obvious. For example:
let x = 1 : x in
  case x of
      _ : _ : _ : _ : _ -> True
matches immediately.
