BUILD NOTES:

On base-4, it requires very little to drop the extensible-exceptions
dependency, just drop the .Extensible from the imports.

TODO:

A detached larger environment so that an actually decent library can be
ticking away behind the scenes. This includes better support for primitive
operations like arithmetic.

Polymorphism?

Everywhere in the program I have emphasised correctness and simplicity of
code over performance. In a lot of small ways and a few big ones the
efficiency of the algorithms involved is much poorer than it needs to be.

Pattern matching can see deep into bindings, which may make how it found
a match non-obvious. For example:
let x = 1 : x in
  case x of
      _ : _ : _ : _ : _ -> True
matches immediately.

FIXME:

Nested let-scopes aren't properly supported.
